JavaScript Exercises – Semester 2

This repository contains a collection of exercises and small projects created during the second semester of my vocational training in application development. During this time, we started working with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** for the first time.

Contents
- **To-Do List** – A simple task manager running in the browser  
- **Prime Number Calculator** – A tool for checking if a number is prime  
- **Some Memes** – Just for fun

These projects document my initial learning progress and serve as practice for essential web development concepts – far from perfect, but created with a lot of fun and curiosity :)
